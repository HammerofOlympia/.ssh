        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>The Iron Warriors are a Legion of the First Founding, formed when the Imperium was young and the Emperor
            walked
            amongst his people. As with the other Legions, they were created after the Primarchs had disappeared.
            Although
            the
            Iron Warriors did not know their Primarch, during those early years they did inherit common
            characteristics,
            notably
            an affinity for technology and a coldly efficient logic, both of which served them well when calculation
            was
            needed,
            but left them lacking in faith. Tragically for the Iron Warriors, they were ultimately to be confronted
            by a
            threat
            against which the only possible defence was unshakeable faith.</p>

        <p> On Olympia the Emperor found the Primarch from whom the Iron Warriors had been fashioned - Perturabo.
            Dark
            and
            melancholy, with a mind like a razor, he was warlord to the Tyrant of Lochos and, like his Legion, was a
            master
            of
            siege craft. By a curious twist of fate, Perturabo had been put in the one place where there was nothing
            for
            him
            to
            learn but the extent of his own superiority.
            Olympia was, in those days ten thousand years gone, a rugged and mountainous world, its population
            concentrated
            within a multitude of city states. The ready availability of quarried stone and the terrain made the
            control
            of
            strategic passes and high ground the key to military security.

            The young Perturabo was discovered climbing the sheer cliffs below the city state of Lochos. Aware that
            this
            was
            no
            ordinary child, the city guard brought him before the Tyrant of Lochos, Dammekos. Intrigued by the
            strange,
            dark
            child, Dammekos took him into his household as if he were his own family. Perturabo never trusted the
            Olympians
            and,
            although Dammekos took time and trouble to win the trust and affection of the boy, Perturabo did not
            respond
            with
            any warmth. Many saw him as a cold youth but when one considers that he had been cast alone into a
            strange
            world
            with no clue as to his own origins or the reason. for his unusual abilities, this is perhaps harsh.</p>

        <p> When the Great Crusade reached Olympia, Perturabo pledged his loyalty to the Еmperor and, as was his
            custom
            with
            his
            Primarchs the Emperor granted Perturabo command of a Space Мarine Legion and suzerainty of the planet as
            the
            Legion's home. The deposed Tyrant of Lochos spent the last few years of his life trying to marshal
            support
            to
            reclaim Olympia. He failed, but created an undercurrent of unrest that was to be harnessed many years
            later.
        </p>

        <p> There was little time to delay. With the Great Crusade in full swing, Perturabo recruited new Iron
            Warriors
            from
            amongst the Olympians and conducted a lightning campaign against the nearby world of Justice Rock and
            the
            heretical
            Black Judges. The new recruites served well and their triumphant return was clebrated in the Palimodes
            Fresco,
            now
            known only through fragmented holo-recordings.

            The Iron Warriors led by Perturabo were devastating siege troops. Expert engineers with cross-training
            from
            the
            Priesthood of Mars, they quickly built on their already impressive reputation. Whilst the Iron Warriors
            were
            determined to serve Mankind and their Emperor, their specialisation was an unfortunate one. The nature
            of
            siege
            warfare is long periods of dull, back-breaking labour broken by the most brutal, merciless combat
            imaginable.
            Men,
            even Space Marines, cannot withstand hell indefinitely and combat fatigue began to brutalise the Iron
            Warriors.
            The
            custom existed that once the siege lines were complete the besieged must either surrender or expect no
            quarter.
            With
            each campaign the Iron Warriors came to prefer the latter. Battle was to these Space Marines a release
            from
            the
            tedium of life in the siege trenches.</p>

        <p> As the Crusade moved forward, many Iron Warrior citadels were established on liberated worlds
            guaranteeing a
            safe
            line of communications. There is a grim irony that the first and last military use of these citadels was
            to
            resupply
            Horus` forces on their traitorous march on Terra. Tiny numbers of Iron Warriors garrisoned the new
            fortifications.
            Where the likes of Russ, Vulkan and Magnus refused to Split their forces, Perturabo obeyed his orders
            with
            increasing bitterness. The Iron Warriors were turning into a garrison Legion with tiny deployments all
            over
            the
            Imperium. For example, the infamous Iron Keep on Delgas II was garrisoned by one squad of ten Iron
            Warriors
            despite
            the world having a disgruntled population of almost 130 million. Resentment began to build up throughout
            the
            Legion
            and particularly with Perturabo himself.</p>

        <p> The passage of years and the carnage of the Heresy have long destroyed any possibility of proving why
            the
            Iron
            Warriors were treated with such casual disdain. Having finally found the truth of his existence,
            Perturabo
            was
            initially fanatically devoted to the Emperor and was ready to embrace missions that the other Primarchs
            avoided.
            The
            Iron Warriors' indisputable success then led to them being 'typecast' to the extent that they became an
            automatic
            choice for a siege or garrison mission. But all troops need time for rest and reorganisation if they are
            to
            be
            at
            their best. Clearly some authority chose to keep the Iron Warriors in action despite the harm it was
            doing.
            The
            Emperor may have been deliberately testing Perturabo's faith but, given that Horus, as Warmaster, had
            control
            over
            the precise conduct of many campaigns, it is more likely that he was responsible. When the Heresy began,
            it
            was
            clear that Horus had already established 'understandings' with other Legions. In hindsight, it is
            perfectly
            conceivable that Horus was working to demoralise and derange the Iron Warriors to make them more
            malleable.
        </p>

        <p> It is widely claimed that Perturabo was envious of Rogal Dorn. Given Dorn's well-attested vanity, one
            can
            imagine
            how frequent reference to the perfection of the defences of the Emperor's palace on Terra might have
            antagonised
            his
            brother Primarch. Dorn had this effect on a great many people but Perturabo brooded on it and let each
            boast
            become
            a open wound that a cunning manipulator could pull and prod to elicit a response.</p>

        <p> It is undoubtedly true that the other Primarchs kept Perturabo at a distance. This may be attributable
            to
            his
            technical genius that was far in advance of any of the others. Perturabo could match wits with Adeptus
            Mechanicus
            Magi on anything from warp drives to macro cannons. This was reflected in the way his deeds are recorded
            in
            the
            legends passed down from those times. In one famous story describing the occasion when Leman Russ and
            Jaghatai
            Khan
            routed the Orks of Overdog Mashogg, Perturabo features only as the 'comrade' who calculated the optimum
            way
            to
            bypass Mashogg's low orbit defences.</p>

        <h3><a id="combat doctrine">Combat Doctrine</a></h3>

        <p>The Iron Warriors follow a simple method. They commence battle with a sustained bombardment utilising
            every
            gun
            at
            their
            disposal. The basis of this is a complex fire plan in which every weapon is directed with utmost care at
            the
            optimum
            target for maximum effect. Where possible, the Iron Warriors will coordinate with Traitor Titan Legions
            to
            add
            to
            their
            own considerable firepower. The bombardment can last for weeks as the Iron Warriors rarely seem to be
            short
            of
            ammunition. They handle their weaponry well, with formations moving forward to fire and then redeploying
            before
            any
            reprisal. Often their entire force will move laterally to bring their fire against enemy weak points,
            with
            the
            result
            that counter-attacks flounder helplessly in the teeth of the Iron Warriors' weapons.

            Where possible, field fortifications will be used to reinforce the line. Iron Warrior doctrine includes
            extensive
            use of
            fortifications to tie opponents down with the absolute minimum number of troops. This in turn keeps the
            bulk
            of
            the
            Iron
            Warriors troops fresh and available for assaults.</p>

        <p> When a breach has been forced in the enemy defences it will initially be probed by veterans and
            infiltrated,
            then
            the
            gap will be prised open with firepower until a storming force can be unleashed.

            These storming forces are based around fast moving heavy armour which can move instantly from relentless
            barrage
            to
            lightning-fast advance. Breaches are then widened until the defences are shattered. For the key moments
            in
            battle
            when a
            position absolutely must be taken, the Iron Warriors adopt an ice-cold ferocity that is comparable to
            the
            Blood
            Angels
            or World Eaters but only when the moment is right and never for longer than necessary.

            Once they have an opponent at their mercy, the Iron Warriors are content to surround them and destroy
            them
            at
            their
            leisure, always preferring to let shell and laser beam do their work for them.</p>

        <p> The Iron Warriors are expert sappers, engineers and miners and have acquired a formidable siege train of
            specialist
            equipment over the centuries. This includes Termite tunnellers, a Leviathan transport, Dreadclaw assault
            boats
            adapted
            for planetary landings and a large assortment of

            Imperial-built artillery. These are used very sparingly and are maintained and guarded by the 1st
            Company.
            Additionally
            they have a number of Corvus assault pods which allow them to make use of any supporting Titans as siege
            towers.
            The
            Iron Warriors are so frequently supported by Titans that some Imperial experts have asserted that they
            are
            part
            of
            the
            same formation. This is not widely accepted, but the theory is a reflection of the Legion's predilection
            for
            heavy
            barrages.</p>
